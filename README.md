# Bayesian Logic Behind The Efect of Delay on Sense of Agency

SoA is found to be decreasing as the delay between the outcome and the action increases.
This study aims to look at whether this effect of the delay is absolute or it is dependent on the existing delays in the experiment.\
In another line of the research, psychophsical mapping of the delay on the sense of agency modulation is examined by comparing the delay sets in whcih the delays vary linearly and logarithmically.

Participants are asked to make a key press which produces a ball with a delay. 
There are 3 different conditions in which the delays differ.

Linear-DelaySet-Condition\
**Delays:** \
Condition1: 200ms 400ms 600ms\
Condition2: 400ms 600ms 800ms\
Condition3: 600ms 800ms 1000ms

Logarithmic-DelaySet-Condition\
**Delays:**\
Condition1: 200ms 300ms 450ms\
Condition2: 300ms 450ms 675ms\
Condition3: 450ms 675ms 10125s

### Mixed subject design
Participants are assigned one of the three conditions randomly. (Between-subject)\
In the task a participant completes, each delay is presented randomly. (Within-subject)
