# Bayesian Logic Behind The Efect of Delay on SoA

SoA is found to be decreasing as the delay between the outcome and the action increases.
This study aims to look at whether this effect of the delay is absolute or it is dependent on the existing delays in the experiment.

Participants are asked to make a key press which produces a ball with a delay. 
There are 3 different conditions in which the delays differ.

**Study 1:** Delays increase aritmethically
**Delays:** 
Condition1: 200ms 400ms 600ms\
Condition2: 400ms 600ms 800ms\
Condition3: 600ms 800ms 1000ms\

**Study 2:** To control discriminability, delays increase geometrically
**Delays:**
Condition1: 200ms 300ms 450ms\
Condition2: 300ms 450ms 675ms\
Condition3: 450ms 675ms 10125s\
